[{"content":"My principal research interests are:\nHomological Algebra I am interested in various homology theories such as Hochschild and cyclic homology of algebras, as well as partial group homology of partial representations.\nPartial Actions and Partial Representations Partial actions are a generalization of usual group (Hopf) actions, focusing on the partial symmetries of a space. I will expand on this topic in a future post. I have conducted research into the categorical and homological properties of partial actions.\nAlgebraic Geometry Recently, I have become heavily interested in this topic. In particular, I am interested in the interplay between partial group actions on commutative algebras and their respective affine schemes.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/interests/","summary":"My principal research interests are:\nHomological Algebra I am interested in various homology theories such as Hochschild and cyclic homology of algebras, as well as partial group homology of partial representations.\nPartial Actions and Partial Representations Partial actions are a generalization of usual group (Hopf) actions, focusing on the partial symmetries of a space.

I obtained my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in mathematics in 2018 from the Industrial University of Santander (Colombia) and my master\u0026rsquo;s degree in mathematics (Cohomology based on partial representations) in 2020 from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) under the direction of Professor Mikhailo Dokuchaev.\nI expect to complete my PhD at the University of SÃ£o Paulo under the supervision of Professor Mikhailo Dokuchaev in August 2024. My PhD research has focused on the (co)homological framework of partial actions of groups and Hopf algebras.\nIn addition to pure mathematics, I have a strong interest in computational mathematics, particularly in the applications of algebra to solve computational problems. Moreover, I enjoy coding programs to solve algebraic problems.\nHere is a copy of my CV.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/aboutme/","summary":"ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Emmanuel Jerez.
