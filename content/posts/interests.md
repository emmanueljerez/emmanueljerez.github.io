My principal research interests are:

### Homological Algebra

I am interested in various homology theories such as Hochschild and cyclic homology of algebras, as well as partial group homology of partial representations.

### Partial Actions and Partial Representations

Partial actions are a generalization of usual group (Hopf) actions, focusing on the partial symmetries of a space. I will expand on this topic in a future post. I have conducted research into the categorical and homological properties of partial actions.

### Algebraic Geometry

Recently, I have become heavily interested in this topic. In particular, I am interested in the interplay between partial group actions on commutative algebras and their respective affine schemes.
