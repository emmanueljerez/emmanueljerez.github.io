ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Emmanuel Jerez. I obtained my bachelor's degree in mathematics in 2018 from the Industrial University of Santander (Colombia) and my master's degree in mathematics (Cohomology based on partial representations) in 2020 from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) under the direction of Professor Mikhailo Dokuchaev.

I expect to complete my PhD at the University of SÃ£o Paulo under the supervision of Professor Mikhailo Dokuchaev in August 2024. My PhD research has focused on the (co)homological framework of partial actions of groups and Hopf algebras.

In addition to pure mathematics, I have a strong interest in computational mathematics, particularly in the applications of algebra to solve computational problems. Moreover, I enjoy coding programs to solve algebraic problems.

Here is a copy of my [CV](files/cv.pdf).
